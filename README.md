# C++ Typelists #

Typelist allows you to store an array of types similarly to an array of values.

The repository contains two implementations and few algorithms operating on
Typelists. One implemetation is inspired by a book **Modern C++ Design** by
Andrei Alexandrescu and one using C++11 Parameter Packs.
